What was it we were talking about?
The bus stop is near our school.
She always dresses in black.
I went to school in Boston.
It is not always cold in Hokkaido.
Her parents can't help worrying about her injuries.
I hope you'll get well soon.
I didn't know about your plan.
Tom looks pale.
We had a very good time last night.
You're just a coward.
The cat caught the rats.
I wonder why I feel so lonely when it gets cold.
I don't think he'll say yes.
I am familiar with this neighborhood.
Is it true that Tom wants to paint his house green?
"Hey, you! What are you doing?"
I came here to thank you.
What're you after?
How's it going at school?
Tom began laughing.
How long did you live there?
He laid on his back.
I wish I could buy a motorcycle.
I always feel blue on Mondays.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Do you have any idea who would do this?
Kill them.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
My heart was filled with happiness.
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
What do you eat for breakfast?
She is as beautiful as her mother.
He kicked the ball into the goal.
It is less humid today than it was yesterday.
You must not jump to conclusions.
You shouldn't keep them waiting so long.
You can have a ride on my motorcycle.
Sometimes I still miss her.
You don't have to go to the party unless you want to.
My sister usually walks to school.
I need to take a shower.
I'll alert Tom.
There must be some misunderstanding between us.
I don't know any blind men.
I said open the door.
Choose the one you like.
I have a black and a white dog.
Please take your shoes off.
Tom is good at cooking.
"After supper, I washed the dishes."
I talked to Tom.
I can't find my glasses.
Do you think Tom is wealthy?
I don't think it's going to be easy to find Tom.
Tom needs Mary's help.
Give me something to eat.
She's not a child.
You gain nothing by speaking ill of others.
Are you carrying a lot of money?
How much is that mountain bike?
Nothing ever makes him angry.
How annoying!
The system worked.
Can you give me some money?
He does not come here every day.
He's a meth addict.
Our baseball team is very strong.
Please be careful not to get hurt.
It's a risk that Tom and I aren't willing to take.
This box is too bulky to carry.
The patient is steadily recovering.
No problem.
Today is my birthday.
The child followed me to the park.
This problem is too difficult for primary school children to solve.
I go to school by bus.
I want to go with you.
I thought that Tom and Mary were crazy.
That's my money.
We love Tom.
I'll stop by your place on my way home.
I have to cook dinner today.
Tell me about some of the places you've visited.
We have a great team.
We enjoyed ourselves very much.
Water freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade.
He acted like a madman.
I can't change what happened yesterday.
Tom will probably never be late again.
She had died before I arrived.
My aunt brought me some flowers.
She was buried in her hometown.
The news confirmed my suspicions.
"Tom, have you eaten anything?"
Tom stayed at this hotel for three weeks.
She took the book back to the library.
How are we going to pay for that?
I carried the box on my shoulder.
Put out the light.
We got involved in a traffic accident.
Whose turn is it?
I asked him about the accident.
I'm so happy.
I owe it you that I am still alive.
This is not a tiger.
We are having a serious talk about your future.
How soon can we leave?
Tom hurt himself.
Mary isn't really sick. She's only pretending to be sick.
I can't help admiring his talent.
Don't do this to me again.
My mother is reading a magazine.
This is where Tom usually parks his car.
Don't go out after dark.
Do your gums bleed?
Tom knows what we're doing.
May I be excused from tomorrow's class?
This little girl let the birds escape.
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
That's absolutely right.
Is there any mail for me today?
My laptop crashed.
Can I have a bottle of red wine?
My father sometimes goes abroad.
Some say that China was like a Russian colony.
I wonder what will happen.
I just need a break.
The fox and the bear lived together.
They were good.
You have good reason to be angry.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
You should have come earlier.
Could you stop saying that?
My sister became a college student.
I'm ready to go back home.
He always tells the truth.
"If you need anything, let me know."
Can you tell me where the flea market is?
He must have said so without giving it much thought.
I am tall.
This book is quite difficult.
An eight-year-old car is almost worthless.
I don't have a desk in my bedroom.
"There are some misprints, but all in all, it's a good book."
"Come on, touch it."
We're friends.
Tom pretty much forgot about the meeting.
Who's your most interesting friend?
What made her do that?
Mt. Asama is now dormant.
Tom got ready for bed.
It would be nice to have a party.
He lives alone in an apartment.
How tall is your brother?
Do you know how to dance?
She's not as beautiful as her sister.
Tell me how he got it.
The big tree was struck by lightning.
They adopted the orphan.
I got to the station this morning.
I always catch colds in the winter.

I'm not feeling that hungry yet.
I didn't know she was married.
I was almost hit by a car.
"Come on, hurry up."
Do Japanese people eat sushi every day?
She rushed home with the good news.
They live across the river.
I don't make deals with people like you.
Nothing is going his way.
She is wearing a white dress today.
A rabbit has long ears and a short tail.
Tom didn't talk to Mary.
She put the dirty dishes in the sink.
Forewarned is forearmed.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
No one listened to me.
I ripped my pants.
I've already eaten lunch.
Tom didn't deny he did that.
That dog is big.
Remember to brush your teeth.
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
He hid himself behind the door.
Don't ask me what it was.
She left her gloves in the car.
She said she was happy.
She looked after the children.
She greeted him waving her hand.
Would you mind saying that once more?
Traffic lights work all the time.
I will be with you tonight.
Be careful with it.
This is true.
Tom told me Mary is leaving tomorrow.
Do you commute to school by bus?
That boy is running.
I'll drive you to the airport.
Feel this.
Tom became a hero.
Please shut the door.
She's a stubborn girl.
No one likes war.
I don't blame you for doing that.
Can you hold on a second?
Do it somewhere else.
She is eager to live in Australia.
I'm very hungry now.
Good morning.
It's obvious that he lied.
Let's hope she comes.
UFO stands for unidentified flying object.
"She tried to lift the box, but found it impossible to do."
"Five gallons of regular, please."
"You didn't come to school yesterday, did you?"
Mastering English is difficult.
Is someone knocking on the door?
He was standing at the door.
The people of London are very proud of this bridge.
I want to know where she went.
Please call a taxi for this lady.
Tom said he's glad he could do that.
We like music.

I am tired of homework.
It would be great if you could sing.
He visited many countries in Asia.
This boy is lazy.
They are sure to fall in love.
He didn't show up at the party.
The food isn't very good here.
You shouldn't share too much private information on the social networks.
She gave us lots to eat.
I'm worried about my weight.
What did you do with that book?
Health is above wealth.
This is exactly what I wanted.
You don't need to thank me.
Everybody wanted to eat.
I must finish this work first.
You may use this car.
There's nothing better than taking a nice walk.
They greeted me with a smile.
I asked him to go there tomorrow.
I am disgusted with him.
He was in America at that time.
I know Tom.
I don't really use Facebook that much.
I'm not very good at swimming.
Would you like me to explain it?
I will give you a bike for your birthday.
Please do that.

I will be at the meeting.
I'm still your friend.
I have a high opinion of this book.
The police are looking into the matter.

A nurse took my temperature.
I admire you.
Tom is overweight.
Maybe you'll succeed.
It'll definitely rain.
They were so young.
He couldn't understand the sentence.
I'll tell my wife.
That's my final answer.
I keep the master copy under lock and key.
I walked as slowly as I could.
My father told me where to go.
I took the fact for granted.
I am not curious.
It was her little sister that broke her toy.
We won the battle.
I can't live without you.
She made faces at that woman.
Is Tom in a lot of trouble?
Everyone knew that Tom's French was good.
You underestimate your charisma.
Would you mind closing the door?
I want to cry.
I shouldn't have sold my house.
You had better not stay up late.
I'm afraid of dying.
It is already past five o'clock.
A lot of houses were washed away by the flood.
I will love you forever.
Tom realized it was time to leave.
Do you need an ambulance?
"Although old, he is still very much alive."
I made a bet that she would win the game.
Do you have a temperature?
Are you Tom's mother?
Can you get it repaired?
Don't touch my camera.
She does not like sushi.
The light is green.
Let's fly a kite.
I have to take the test again.
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
Tom says that he's willing to help.
Do you think animals have a soul?
How much is the bus fare?
I'm already married.
He objected to his wife working outside.
Does he know that you love him?
Stop gawking.
For what purpose?
He's a good person.
The children are having fun in the park.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his keys.
Make sure you get plenty of rest.
Could you bring me some water?
What do you know?
Tom wanted Mary to say that she loved him.
I do not know when she will come back.
I have a job for you.
This book is worth reading again.
We must go to school.
He earned as much money as possible.
I'm suffering from a bad cold.
This is your only chance.
I can't hear you.
Are you coming tomorrow?
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
It's not as easy to do that as people think.
The buildings look so tiny.
Tom has blue eyes.
How are you going to get home?
"Stop, or I'll shoot."
Tom takes the bus to the city.
Clean the dirt off the mirror.

She made the same mistake as before.
Would you like some more beer?
It worried me that she looked pale.
She wept bitterly.
It was a great shock to me.
Tom called the police.
Why do you need it?
I'm going to help you rescue Tom.
Would you please wait for a few minutes?
You have too many books on the shelf.
I miss you very much.
My father often washes the dishes.
Here is my baggage.
She doesn't know how to play golf.
He can't swim.
How about another beer?
This one's yours.
"After supper, I washed the dishes."
May I open the window?
"To make matters worse, he isn't even conscious of annoying his neighbors."
This decision is final.
"""I think so, too,"" she chimed in."
They're all the same size.
It's too expensive.
Are you going to come back?
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
She will give her picture to whoever wants it.
It's very hot this morning.
Is it really worth it?
Tom's speech was excellent.
Tom didn't have dinner last night.

Tom took a step backward.
What time does it open?
I want a boat.
She was crying as she answered.
The phone is ringing.
What time will you have breakfast?
I hope everything goes well.
Did he tell you what to do?
"If it happened to Tom, it could happen to you."
This time it's different.
"How are you, Tom?"
He keeps his room clean.
Tom and his friends played basketball all afternoon.
Let's take turns rowing the boat.
We have plenty of time to spare.
I borrow money.
I'll wait here till he comes back.
"Tom, I want to have a chat with you."
There's no salt.
I think I know who did it.
He's running very quickly.
Please tell me about it.
I like red wine better than white wine.
Could you show me this bag?
Both of my brothers are married.
What time do you open?
I remember seeing her somewhere.
"""When will you be back?"" ""It all depends on the weather."""
Control is everything.
I vowed that I would never speak to her again.
They're trying to control you.
I'd like to know the exact time.

The meeting ended.
I would like to become a poet.
"I don't know, nor do I care."
Tom left his umbrella on the bus.
Should Tom be worried?
I've won first prize!
Nobody tried to help Tom.
I've been here for a very long time.
He is old enough to drive.
You're working hard.
You must be careful not to make him angry.
Do you know where Tom is waiting for us?
They don't always obey their parents.

Tom likes science fiction.
His decision to retire surprised all of us.

The birds sang.
I want an MP3 player!

All you have to do is take advantage of this rare opportunity.
I consider myself fairly fluent in French.
You made a wise choice.
I'm able to swim.
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
Tom put the large picnic basket on the passenger seat next to him.
Some people clung to tree branches for several hours to avoid being washed away by the floodwaters.
She looked more beautiful than ever.
You never get my jokes.
The curtains make this room beautiful.
I love her and she loves me.
This is smaller than that.
"Maybe I'll go, and maybe I won't."
We're special.
I have a car.
Is there someone that can drive?
That makes no sense at all.
He joined the Army during the war.
I want you to stay a little longer.

She was out of Japan last year.
Tom was wearing jeans.
The manager approved our plan.
You are allowed to use the hotel's swimming pool.
"Tom is a good friend of yours, isn't he?"
She lost her way and on top of that it began to rain.
We live together.
Why did you begin without me?
"Father always says, ""Do your best."""
I started thinking about Tom.
He rested for a while.
My dog goes everywhere with me.
I bought that car.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
I have a dream.
She's still dependent on her parents.
Japan imports various raw materials from abroad.
Finishing the report by tomorrow is next to impossible.
She handed him the key.
He looked for every possible means of escape.
This store is currently selling vegetables.
We know that this is impossible.
Tom took out his key and opened the door.
Don't be sad.
Have a look at the world map.
There are many stores in this area.
Fill the bucket with water.
The plane flew toward the west.

Nothing much has changed.
Tom can't swim.
Please say it once more.
It seems that I've lost my keys.
This medicine will do you good.
The murmur of the brook lulls me to sleep.
Take whatever you like.
We can see more and more swallows.
He's afraid of the dog.
I'm very thirsty.
She decided to resign.
I think I've found the answer.
He told me that I looked pale and asked me what the matter was.
Are both Tom and Mary Canadians?
Did anybody ask you to come here?
How horrible!
How many years did Tom spend in Boston?
That's a face I've seen before.
Those chairs are in the way.
They were afraid.
Don't tell me you didn't know.
Tom swam.
"Some of them are healthy, but others are not."
I met him while I was coming home.
I am expecting a letter from her.
My husband reads the newspaper while eating breakfast.
Tom is deceitful.
"London, where I live, used to be famous for its fog."
The door is locked at nine o'clock.
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
They were only interested in selling books.
Tom comes home every day at 2:30.
The meeting has almost ended.
It has always been a pleasure to work with you.
"After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath."
Such a plan is bound to fail.
Japan depends on imports for raw materials.
We were unable to make contact with them until it was too late.
At what age did you have your first girlfriend?
Tom died in an accident.
His advice counted for little.
I can only give you ten minutes.
This is a wig.
See you tomorrow in the library.
Arrangements have already been made.
No arrests were ever made.
Would you please write with a ballpoint pen?
The box is empty.
Tom is a native speaker of French.
It became dark before I knew it.
He is rotten to the core.
He is doing very well at school.
What did you major in at college?
Where were you?
I appreciate your cooperation.
Whose ring is that?
I can't sleep at all!
"""I never thought Tom would win."" ""Me neither."""
I was about to go look for you.
Keep it up!
How much are you paying Tom?
They made me go there alone.
It's raining.
Let's meet again soon.
I forgot to ask Tom.
Let's do it another time.
He was forced to work overtime.
I had fun last night.
It's about time to go to school.
I don't like that.
"In London, the police are always worried about finding a bomb on the train or subway."
"Which do you like better, spring or autumn?"
I paid him a visit yesterday.
I can't ask Tom right now.
"For the teacher, teaching her was fun."
The price of the book was $5.
She can sing and dance beautifully.
They reported seeing the incident.
Do you feel any pain in your stomach?
She cried as she read the letter.
We didn't intend to attack him.
He goes to the office by car.
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
He put a hand gently on her shoulder.
She asked me a question.
He was involved in the trouble.
They should arrive by ten o'clock.
I didn't ask Tom for help.
Tom is the only boy in our class.
I'm looking for books on Roman history.
I was invited to their wedding.
It is difficult to understand his theory.
I'm new at this kind of work.
I am learning two foreign languages.
Let me in.
You can't park around here.
"I hear you, but I don't see you."
Tom begged his father to buy him a new bicycle.
Please open the door.
"You've told Tom, haven't you?"
I am getting off at the next station.
"I'd like a window seat, please."
It'll be cloudy.
None of them could understand what she was implying.
I enjoyed talking with him at the party.
Please answer all the questions.
He poured cold water over himself.
The phone rang while I was taking a shower.
I met him by chance on the train this morning.
He is always forgetting things.
We ordered Chinese food.
A little bird told me.
She was wearing long boots.
She glanced briefly at the newspaper.
Wow! It's been a long time.
You're the only one who can help us.
I have a Facebook account.
The things he says are entirely inconsequential.
Sunday is not a workday for me.
The soccer game is tomorrow.
Does Tom still like jazz?
Would you like to listen?
My grandmother lives by herself.
I don't often do that by myself.
Tom has no manners.
Can you translate this song for me?
You should always tell the truth.
I don't care if it snows.
Can you feel the difference?
He had decided on a new policy.
I like short hair.
We can't know what the future has in store.
I'd like to have cake for dessert.
Four hundred million people speak English as their first language.
I have a lot of friends living in Boston.
We started at six.
The job offer still stands.
Popcorn is my favorite snack.
I'm not really prepared.
Tom wasn't smiling when he entered the room.
"I can read German, but I can't speak it."
How many pictures did you buy?
What is that big building in front of us?
Do you like Japanese food?
Can I use your pen?
I'm glad to see you back.
It's too late to apologize.
"""Will you have some more coffee?"" ""No, thanks. I've had enough."""
Have a nice trip!
My father goes jogging every morning.
I accepted the offer.
She discovered that she had run out of salt.
Everyone was drunk.
Let's go home.
Have you washed the car yet?
You are not to leave this room.
Tom looked Mary in the eye.
My father repaired my old watch.
Doctors refused to perform a second operation.
I gazed at the sea for hours.
Do you really think that I look like Tom?

She says she will call you later.
She does not have a ticket.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
Please don't misunderstand me.
I returned the book to the library.
Tom was at home.
"Tom came to the conclusion that no matter what he did, Mary wouldn't like it."
I admitted that I didn't know how to do that.
Tom has a big appetite.
What a lot of pens!
That nurse is very kind and polite.
I am going to play tennis tomorrow.
What did you guys go see?
I helped him with his homework.
Tom loves doing this.
Something has happened to my car.
I've heard this joke before.
My dad died before I was born.
I don't know where we'll arrive.
There's a bottle of white wine in the refrigerator.
Only a few TV programs are worth watching.
Parents teach their children that it's wrong to lie.
We'll go when it quits raining.
I shave every morning.
"Although I enjoy bowling, I haven't gone bowling recently."
Why did you open the box?
Tom has been driving all day.
Follow me.
I had to abstain from smoking while I was in the hospital.
"By the way, my English is absolutely hopeless."
I don't know if I can do it.
They had a lovely time together.
Behave yourself.
We are in the era of atomic energy.
Her garden is a work of art.
The tsunami alert was cancelled.
I know someone who might be able to help.
I just can't believe it.
Why are you so smart?
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
Do you know how to drive this thing?
It might rain.
He was home alone at the time.
I love you more than anyone else.
How much does a kilo of bananas cost?
I can solve the problem by myself.
I am positive that he is wrong.
It's much more convenient.
"If it were not for your help, I could not succeed."
I know that you are learning French at school.
They won't come until tomorrow.
I'll carry this suitcase for you.
We hope you will enjoy the show.
I'll get some glasses.
Are you reading an interesting book?
I just want to know what actually happened.
I am cold.
Let's synchronize our watches.
She was satisfied with the new dress.
Tom ate only one sandwich.
I can't see anything without my glasses.
Tom showed up just in time.
I am okay.
You look very pale.
We were worried.
Does he study English every day?
I'm all ears.
How was your exam?
You should be more reasonable.
Are you sure?
Do you know whether she can speak English?
Put your hands up!
Tom hasn't said a word all morning.
Hold fire.
"Which do you like better, rock music or classical music?"
Who will provide capital for the venture?
English and German are two related languages.
I want a guitar.
He is unsatisfied with the result.
Did you get up early?
"She loves chocolate, too."
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Thousands of people died of hunger.
That isn't Tom's fault.
This place gives me a really bad vibe.
The bread isn't fresh.
You can dig dirt from the ground.
Is this the train for New York?
I don't think she can speak French.
They love each other.
I asked for a table over there.
He is just my age.
I heard an unusual sound.
I have no clue.
You must be mentally exhausted.
I heard our dog barking all night.
She taught me how to write a poem.
His office is near the train station.
Everyone who knew him admired him.
Why can't Tom come to us?
"Perseverance, as you know, is the key to success."
Tom was never happy.
He ate all of the apple.
His mother looks young for her age.
"Iron the inside of collars first, and then the outside."
She warned him not to go alone.
Tom isn't planning to stay.
This is a true story.
My watch gains five minutes a day.
We went to the mountains to ski.
They are leaving Japan tomorrow.
Let me stop you right there. We don't want to hear about that.
He lives just around the corner.
"I know that you're busy, too."
You'll never guess what Tom bought.
It is a pity that you can't join us.
When will that new school open?
Your answer is wrong.
He appeared at last.
He's a little pale.
He has a round face.
Do you like apples?
"This is a good book, but that one is better."
Does this letter have to be written in English?
Safety is the most important thing.
But I don't want to.
You need to shed some pounds.
What do you say to taking a walk in the park?
Please give me something to eat.
I don't see why I had to come along.
We're against war.
I've just started playing tennis.
Tom doesn't want to lose Mary.
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
Tom laughed for no reason.
I'm learning how to drive.
What kind of person is she?
Spanish is her native language.
Our teacher has a wonderful sense of humor.
I'll go shopping tomorrow.
Tom had never lied to me before.
You may choose any book you like.
Tom didn't know exactly what it was that Mary wanted him to do.
Don't you feel cold?
I have nothing to fall back on.
I've got it right here.
She can swim as fast as her brother.
My father began jogging last month.
She is an obstinate girl.
I won't be here tomorrow.
When to start is the main problem.
You talk as if you knew everything.
I owe a lot of money.
This is a wooden table.
No one came except Tom.
I'd like to go abroad one day.
You should've told me yesterday.
Tom couldn't decide where to begin.
We were just talking about you when you called.
We don't have any more bread.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
Do you know what I'm doing?
He knows better than to marry her.
I am interested in this story.
I slept only two hours.
Nobody knows why.
Both of her cheeks turned red.
"After I got married, my Japanese got better and I could understand more."
He made his way to the room.
Hi.
I like L.A. better.
Are you for or against his idea?
Tom is a high school student.
He got engaged to my cousin.
I'll be here for a while.
I am in the house.
It's a good question.
I am at home.
Would you lend me your pencil?
Fresh food is wonderful.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
We had a nice time last night.
How did you come by this money?
Tom gets up at six every morning.
Why don't you want to tell us the truth?
He was standing at the street corner.
Tom doesn't drive as carefully as I do.
My father bought a new car.
Thank you for your patience.
We know that all men are mortal.
She waited for you for two hours.
A mouse is a timid creature.
He admonished them for being noisy.
Where's the dining room?
"In Japan, the new school year begins in April."
Tom typed in the password.
I'm tired of watching television.
The storm abated.
Mary won't listen to her friend's advice.
Did you make that mistake on purpose?
Don't forget to lock up when you leave.
I have a dim memory of my grandmother.
I called her up.
Did you get my letter?
Do you have a mobile phone?
"I warned him, but he ignored the warning."
Many friends came to see me off.
I'll see you next month.
He gave him a book.
Bread is made from wheat.
That was the first time that a man walked on the moon.
My room is twice as big as his.
You need to register by Monday.
The polar bears are dying.
Do you need to buy anything?
He committed suicide.
Do you come here often?
Don't translate English into Japanese word for word.
Kobe is famous for its port.
I'm a college student.
He gave in.
May I ask you some more questions?
What did you do with those books?
It was a bag that I lost in the room yesterday.
You must gather further information.
Japan is not as big as Canada.
Do you deliver on Sundays?
Please let me go.
"You don't like love stories, do you?"
You can park here.
It's a clear day.
Tom heard a shout.
You were treated unfairly.
Don't play baseball here.
He erased his speech from the tape.
I must repay the debt.
"If it rains tomorrow, I won't go."
Please show me your injured arm.
I can't let you give me your last ten dollars.
Tom told me what to say.
He is at her side.
A Mexican taught him Spanish.
He is a Japanese boy.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license.
What's my room number?
Leave my car alone.
Bring him in.
It isn't as hard as you think.
Can I eat this?
Do you want to drink some water?
"You have three cars, don't you?"
You are not a coward.
You didn't need to bring your umbrella.
Can I help?
I suggest that you don't trust Tom too much.
I was quite hungry.
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
The concert is about to start.
You are very early this morning.
How are you doing in school?
I understand how to solve the problem.
I am looking for an assistant.
I know what his name is.
Tom is my grandfather.
Tom picked up a pencil.
Let's meet at one o'clock.
The phone rang.
Money isn't the only thing that matters.
I'm no longer your assistant.
What's your job?
I have never thought of that.
How much is this?
Fish is cheap today.
I was always good at English.
My parents sent me a postcard.
We import tea from India.
Everyone knows that Tom's French is good.
A fire broke out last night and three houses were burnt down.
Sometimes you get lucky.
This pen doesn't write well.
This book is yours.
My house doesn't have a roof.
"For the time being, I am studying French at this language school."
I felt as if I were in a dream.
I missed my chance.
Has Tom come back already?
He is one of the greatest artists in Japan.
Tom bought a pair of black leather shoes.
That's exactly what I wanted to see happen.
I've been looking for my tripod.
Spring is just around the corner.
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
I like winter better than summer.
"Tom, have you already eaten lunch?"
You must send for the doctor.
He's going to have a heart attack.
You are taller than she is.
This is my bike.
I want to see you again.
The teacher made him stay after school.
We work in a factory.
Tom should have handled the situation differently.
Neptune is the eighth planet of the solar system.
I admit that he is right.
He was made captain.
What're you laughing at?
She said that she was ill.
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow.
It hasn't been easy for Tom to deal with Mary's health problems.
I did nothing during the holidays.
He has a lot of money.
I would like to know her name.
I'd love to find out why she said so.
I guess that would be all right.
Her look says that she loves you.
He made no mention of her request.
He has lots of money.
We left home early in the morning.
Tomorrow is my day off.
"Water is liquid. When it freezes, it becomes solid."
How much money do I owe you?
It would take forever for me to explain everything.
Tom is a good worker.
"To my surprise, the door was unlocked."
Remember to cross your t's.
He is rarely in a good mood.
The weather was so cold that the lake froze over.
Did you actually see the accident?
He changed schools last year.
The truth is that nothing is totally true or false.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
I go to school.
This desk is made of wood.
That's my sole concern.
I'm reading a book about animals.
My father works at a factory.
Is Tom ready for that?
We ran three kilometers.
We had a good time playing chess.
Everything's normal.
He is a person who never cuts corners.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
His house was small and old.
I enjoy taking pictures.
"My husband earns $100,000 a year."
We're going to paint the wall.
Who are the two women over there?
"I've never been to New York, and my sister hasn't, either."
I'm pretty busy.
"No matter how hard the training was, she never cried."
Bring the water to a boil.
Tom puts gas in his car twice a week.
That white parasol is hers.
The earthworm wriggled when I touched it.
I feel cold.
Let's drive to the lake.
The ship was flying the American flag.
The neighborhood was silent.
Tom was never very good at swimming.
Could you put my name on the waiting list?
I need more money.
We can't just fire Tom.
Tom can't cross the border.
Promises aren't enough.
We ran short of money.
Haven't we met somewhere before?
Have a good weekend.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
We know him.
She may come.
Tom played with his dog.
I know everything that you've done.
I think we were well-prepared.
There's nothing else we can do.
What steps should we take?
He never goes out late at night.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
I met an old woman.
She took care of the poor little bird.
I'm going to get rid of all this stuff.
Did you have to get up very early this morning?
Why did she come home early?
I don't go to school on Sundays.
Tom and Mary stayed at a fancy hotel.
You don't have any money.
You don't know how worried I am.
My grandfather's photograph is on the wall.
I'd like something to eat.
She must be over eighty.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
How long can it be kept going with 100 dollars?
Let's get together again!
Would you mind shutting the door?
She went from London to Paris.
I saw a beautiful waterfall there.
Study hard so you don't fail.
You're in better shape than I am.
She saw a young man at the entrance.
Tom is a strange person.
He studied hard in order to get into college.
He looks like a good boy.
I thought pizza was what you wanted to eat.
I like red wine better than white.
I'll scold him.
Everyone I know uses Google.
I wish you had told me that.
Why did we fail?
I have already read today's paper.
What did you have for lunch?
He likes watching TV.
He has a brother who lives in Tokyo.
A little walk will give you a good appetite for breakfast.
They don't like me.
Tom started the engine.
He told me the story of his life.
This paragraph is vague.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
Tom also talked.
The worst is over.
Please wish me luck.
What does it contain?
I'm out of time.
You are lying.
Few things give us as much pleasure as music.
Thanks for telling me the truth.
The life span of a butterfly is short.
The clock is above the fireplace.
This is impossible.
My father is in the habit of reading the newspaper before breakfast.
Don't forget to take a camera.
Step out of the car and place your hands behind your back.
I'll lend you the book as soon as I'm done reading it.
Their eyes met.
I did my best.
I am going out this afternoon.
You look very good.
We had some chicken soup.
I thought it was true.
I know who lives in this house.
It's fun to travel.
I always keep my promises.
It's very big.
The baby is sleeping in the cradle.
It's cold.
Let's take a rest for a while.
He is the man you met the other day.
I've been careful my whole life.
Three cubed is twenty-seven.
The project was a complete failure.
He's the manager of the marketing department.
She walks.
Her father passed away last week.
My father goes to church on Sunday.
The investigation is under way.
This desk is better than that one.
They waited for him for hours.
Do you ever dream about flying through the sky?
Thousands of people lost their jobs.
Everyone in the town knows about it.
You owe me an apology for that.
I help my mother with the housework every day.
She is the one who feeds our dog.
He has had a crush on her.
She doesn't have a driver's license.
I had nothing in common with them.
Wake up!
My sister often cries.
It's about the size of an egg.
He is learning how to drive a car.
Don't forget that Tom is allergic to peanuts.
All the dogs are alive.
I walked along the river.
Does it taste good?
Did you buy her something for Christmas?
She borrowed a saw from the farmer.
It was not long before we met again by chance.
She must have been sick.
It might rain.
I'll make you happy.
"Long time, no see. I hear that you've changed your job again."
I like singing with Tom.
Doing this is a lot of fun.
He's three years older than she is.
This medicine will make you feel better.
He does not come here every day.
Tom was advised by Mary not to go there by himself.
You look bored.
I haven't heard that story yet.
Drive slowly.
Is it next Monday that Tom returns?
How high can you jump?
I am amazed at your audacity.
Did your uncle let you drive his car?
Would you like a little more salad?
You can rely upon his being punctual.
He was laughed at by his friends.
Please show me the menu.
This message doesn't make sense.
Tom didn't buy any bread.
Are you sure about this?
Do I need surgery?
The doctor told her that she should take a rest.
You must control yourself.
They came all the way from Brazil.
I spoke with him about the matter.
Please continue.
The rain prevented me from going.
I really like puppies.
Tom helped me with the move.
Smiles do not always indicate pleasure.
What's going on with you?
"That's awesome, right?"
There is a village over the mountain.
Wonderful!
I've been here for a long time.
I'll be taking a vacation next month.
What's your job here?
You had better go to the infirmary.
You are in a safe place.
Let's do it another time.
I took a cab to the station.
I don't plan to stay very long.
What time do you close?
I get along with my younger brother.
It is an hour's drive from here to there.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this song became a hit.
You will be able to see him tomorrow.
That job paid well.
"Hurry up, or you will miss the train."
You're not me.
That's what I have to do.
She is good at playing tennis.
I don't like this.
I had a good night's sleep.
She seemed to have been ill.
Yesterday was my birthday.
The boy who lives next door often comes home late.
"Believe it or not, she has three children."
I almost caught the fish.
You don't have to go to school on Sunday.
"Could I see you a minute, please?"
I am a Japanese high school girl.
It is rude to laugh at others.
The island is a paradise for children.
Taking off is easier than landing.
Rome is famous for its ancient architecture.
Tom is not as old as you.
Everybody will die.
Stay right here and relax.
I hurried in order to catch the first train.
I am on the right.
Are you going outside?
Is it going to snow tonight?
I always enjoy listening to classical music when I have some free time.
I was brought up in the country.
It's well done.
She went to the hospital yesterday.
I even made Tom laugh.
Have you been fired?
Thank you for baking this delicious cake.
We didn't break in.
She put on socks.
I got lost in the woods.
Do you have siblings?
Are you busy?
What's her job?
I'm a detective.
You reap what you sow.
There is little water in the pond.
She complained about my low salary.
She gave us a present.
I have to study for the test.
I think I'm intelligent.
Now it is official.
Tom is the one I saw.
She sat on the bench.
"I bought the book for myself, not for my wife."
That's a nice coat.
Those tulips are beautiful.
He practiced every day at home.
He drank a lot yesterday.
My house is a long way from here.
He is known as a great poet.
Mary said she would do her homework.
Tom can swim faster than anyone else I know.
I wonder if he'll come tonight.
I think skateboards are usually cheaper than rollerblades.
Watch my camera for me.
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
Please have a look at this book.
You'd better start now.
I felt a drop of rain on my head.
I will not do it again.
There isn't anyone in the room.
People in the United States speak English.
Could you tell me where I can get a bus?
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
He knows how to make a radio.
Are you listening to English?
Of course she passed the test.
I had an accident at work.
I like being on the team.
How much do you want in terms of salary?
There's no one in your bedroom.
"Mary is very cute, isn't she?"
Were you serious about that?
My mother never punishes me.
I'm old enough to support myself.
It is really time for us to go.
Is it true that your family will travel in Hokkaido? I envy you.
He jumped onto the table.
She caught colds often.
He doesn't have any friends.
He is in the kitchen.
I'll eat it here.
She has seen better days.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
Lawyers are all liars.
Your tripod is in my office.
What was the cause of the explosion?
Are you happy now?
How do you account for that?
You must always keep your hands clean.
I don't think that he's honest.
"Even though he has a lot of money, he's not happy."
Money can't buy happiness.
I'm as old as he is.
How long did it take you to write this report?
He's crazy about soccer.
Tom told me that he didn't want to go with us.
When did you begin studying English?
I made him paint the house.
You're in my way.
There are 30 students in our class.
Tom can swim pretty well.
Nagoya is to the east of Kyoto.
Tom has forgotten how to do that.
She must have done it yesterday.
Let me come in.
Which countries have you visited?
You don't need to worry about such a thing.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
He made mistakes on purpose to annoy me.
What should I look for?
"Three months later, Tom was dead."
The only thing I have now are memories.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
I can't wait for you.
This is quite good.
I owe Tom some money.
He painted a dog.
You are always as busy as a bee.
Once again.
Our train is delayed.
The company invested a lot of money in this project.
Tom couldn't help but smile.
I don't care if you trust me or not.
She made fun of her husband.
Nobody's laughing.
I get a kick out of her cheerful personality.
My father takes a walk every morning.
He has made a fortune through hard work.
Who would want to hire Tom?
Could you tell me?
Who were you talking to?
"Which do you prefer, tea or coffee?"
Why don't you stay here?
She's correct for sure.
I saw him crossing the street.
"""Did he write a letter yesterday?"" ""Yes, he did."""
We don't have too much time.
Who wrote this story?
I should have left earlier.
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
All of them are not present.
I'm getting farsighted as I get older.
One of my pleasures is watching TV.
I've seen Tom naked.
They closed their eyes.
This dog eats almost anything.
Manholes are round because that way they won't accidentally fall through the hole.
Tom deleted his Facebook account.
This isn't my key.
The cancer has spread to her stomach.
There were no mistakes.
Close the door.
We consider it a blessing.
Did I tell you I got a new job?
It's very easy to learn how to swim.
The dog saved the girl's life.
May I have a talk with you?
Do you go to church?
I can do without his help.
Are you on the committee?
"You're a friend of Tom's, aren't you?"
Do you want anything to eat?
My briefcase is full of papers.
Tom finally gave up smoking.
We have barely enough bread for breakfast.
The poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator.
My aunt made me a new skirt.
Do you want to eat this?
He likes anything sweet.
The room smelled of tobacco.
I wish I could stop hiccuping.
The vending machines are over there.
I'm such an unlucky guy.
His new car is wonderful.
They may have missed the train.
Your father is pretty tall.
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
I don't want the present Tom gave me.
I'd like to reserve a single room.
You have to turn in the reports on Monday.
This room is too small.
Let's begin.
Our school begins at eight-thirty.
Give this book to whoever wants it.
I'll dream about you.
We gave the car a push.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
I'm calling from a cell phone.
I can't reach it.
Who's that guy?
What's your opinion on that?
I studied English when I was there.
Please come back as soon as possible.
Zip your lips.
Father is watering flowers.
They're 30 minutes behind schedule.
I'm interested in history.
I'm glad you were right.
Do you understand?
See how high you can jump.
Lots of famous people come here.
My camera can shoot high-definition video.
She cannot be over thirty.
You shouldn't have done that.
He can do it better than I can.
I can only speak for myself.
Africa was once called the Dark Continent.
We should've stayed at home.
They should all be fired.
You're really wonderful.
I don't have a bicycle.
I accept the offer.
Can I ask you some questions?
I wish Tom were my younger brother.
There is a large supermarket.
Please give me some advice on what I should do.
"Right now, we have blueberries, blackberries, cherries, strawberries, peaches and nectarines."
She's my sister.
Can I have it?
You should be ashamed of your ignorance.
Tom is taking a day off.
Subtract three from eight and you get five.
Why do you have two cars?
How is it going?
It seems very interesting.
I'm always busy with my homework.
Did Tom say anything?
Farmers always complain about the weather.
Are they both the same?
Don't you play tennis?
Last summer I traveled to Italy.
I thank you with all my heart.
Where do you play tennis?
She gave me some practical advice.
She gave me a strange look.
"Tom said he was ill, which was a lie."
Let me go alone.
Do you smoke?
Is this your first visit to Japan?
Not all aliens are bad.
How much is this camera?
This has been the driest six months in thirty years.
"Turn off the light, please."
The dolphin and trainer communicated much better than we expected.
He is leaving Chicago tomorrow.
Tom lost his balance and fell down.
Does she like oranges?
My parents live in the country.
I hope no one saw me dancing.
I think I've found something better.
Tom has to speak French every day at work.
My sister has a nice piano.
She gave it her personal attention.
Tom was popular.
"Could you take this, please?"
Be happy for me.
This is a new experience for Tom.
"Without your advice, I would have failed."
Did they live here?
Very few people live to be 100.
This house is really beautiful.
She cooked the dinner herself.
It turned out that I was right.
I trust him.
The light changed from red to green.
He went there instead of his father.
Are you coming along with us?
We were born to die.
I wish Tom would just go away.
I am interested in English.
He used to be a nice boy.
Arabic is read from right to left.
It's obvious why his stomach hurts.
I brought you a little something.
Happy New Year!
Could you recommend another hotel?
Why do you even care about this?
The court acquitted him of the charge of murder.
Would you let me know when Tom comes?
Aren't you thirsty?
They killed time playing cards.
I'll do it.
When will you leave?
The students are all at their desks now.
It makes no sense at all.
Tom remained standing as the others sat down.
How about going for a drive?
The poor young man finally became a great artist.
I'm absolutely elated.
The ceremony began with his speech.
I prefer to travel by air.
Were you at home yesterday?
Who are your most interesting friends?
When did you start working here?
"Well, girls, it's time to go."
Shakespeare is too hard to read.
Would you like to eat something?
Wait for me in the car.
How many books does he have?
